Exercise 4

1. The CUSTOMER table of a state electricity board consists of the following fields:-

Meter Number Varchar 4

Meter Type Char 1

Previous Reading Int 5

Current Reading Int 5

Customer Type Char 1

Last Bill payment Char 1 (values could be ‘Y’ or ‘N’)

There are two types of meters viz. 3- phase or 1-phase coded as ‘T’ or ‘S’ respectively. There are 4 types of customers viz. Agricultural Industrial, Commercial and Residential with codes ‘A’ , ‘I’, ‘C’ and ‘R’ respectively.

Formulae:-
Units used = Current Reading – Previous Reading Rate =Rs.1/ 1.25/ 1.50/ 1.30 for A/I/C/R respectively.
Amount = rate*units used
Surcharge = 5% for single phase
10% for 3 phase
Excise = 30% of (amount +Surcharge)
Net = Amount +Surcharge + Excise

Write a block to calculate the bill for each customer. The program should insert the Meter no., Units used, Rate, Amount, Surcharge, Excise duty and Net for each customer into some other suitable table. Also, at the end, it should insert the total Amount, Surcharge, Excise and Net into some other table.
