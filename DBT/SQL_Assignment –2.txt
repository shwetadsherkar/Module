SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT 5;

(2)SQL Server: Use the TOP clause:

SELECT TOP 5 * FROM table_name;

(3)PostgreSQL: Similar to MySQL, use the LIMIT clause:

sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
LIMIT 5;

(4)Oracle SQL: Use the ROWNUM pseudocolumn:

sql
SELECT * FROM table_name
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;
