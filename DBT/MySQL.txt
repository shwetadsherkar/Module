Exercise 5
1. Write a stored function to take three parameters, the sides of a triangle. The sides of the triangle should be accepted from the user. The function should return a Boolean value:- true if the triangle is valid, false otherwise. A triangle is valid if the length of each side is less than the sum of the lengths of the other two sides. Check if the dimensions entered can form a valid triangle.

2. Write a function that generates a random number between 1 and 10. Use any logic of your choice to achieve this.
3. Create a function that accepts a string of n characters and exchanges the first character with the last, the second with the next – to – last, and so forth until n exchanges have been made. What will the final string look like? Write the function to verify your conclusion.
